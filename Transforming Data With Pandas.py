In this mission, we'll continue working with the World Happiness Report and explore another aspect of it that we haven't analyzed yet - the factors that contribute happiness. As a reminder, the World Happiness Report assigns each country a happiness score based on a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10.
You may recall from previous missions that each of the columns below contains the estimated extent to which each factor contributes to the happiness score:
Economy (GDP per Capita)
Family
Health (Life Expectancy)
Freedom
Trust (Government Corruption)
Generosity
Throughout this mission, we'll refer to the columns above as the "factor" columns. We'll work to answer the following question in this mission:
Which of the factors above contribute the most to the happiness score?
However, in order to answer this question, we need to manipulate our data into a format that makes it easier to analyze. We'll explore the following functions and methods to perform this task:
Series.map()
Series.apply()
DataFrame.applymap()
DataFrame.apply()
pd.melt()
For teaching purposes, we'll focus just on the 2015 report in this mission. As a reminder, below are the first five rows of the data set:
Country	Region	Happiness Rank	Happiness Score	Standard Error	Economy (GDP per Capita)	Family	Health (Life Expectancy)	Freedom	Trust (Government Corruption)	Generosity	Dystopia Residual
0	Switzerland	Western Europe	1	7.587	0.03411	1.39651	1.34951	0.94143	0.66557	0.41978	0.29678	2.51738

Below are descriptions for some of the other columns we'll work with in this mission:
Country - Name of the country
Region - Name of the region the country belongs to
Happiness Rank - The rank of the country, as determined by its happiness score
Happiness Score - A score assigned to each country based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10
Dystopia Residual- Represents the extent to which the factors above over or under explain the happiness score. Don't worry too much about this column - you won't need in depth knowledge of it to complete this mission.
Let's start by renaming some of the columns in happiness2015.'''

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

happiness_2015 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2015.csv")
happiness_2016 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2016.csv")
happiness_2017 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2017.csv")
mapping = {'Economy (GDP per Capita)': 'Economy', 
'Health (Life Expectancy)': 'Health', 
'Trust (Government Corruption)': 'Trust' }
happiness_2015 = happiness_2015.rename(mapping, axis = 1)


'''When we reviewed happiness2015 in the last screen, you may have noticed that each of the "factor" columns consists of numbers:
Country	Happiness Score	Economy	Family	Health	Freedom	Trust	Generosity
0	Switzerland	7.587	1.39651	1.34951	0.94143	0.66557	0.41978	0.29678
1	Iceland	7.561	1.30232	1.40223	0.94784	0.62877	0.14145	0.43630
2	Denmark	7.527	1.32548	1.36058	0.87464	0.64938	0.48357	0.34139
3	Norway	7.522	1.45900	1.33095	0.88521	0.66973	0.36503	0.34699
4	Canada	7.427	1.32629	1.32261	0.90563	0.63297	0.32957	0.45811
Recall that each number represents the extent to which each factor contributes to the happiness score.
However, not only is this definition a little hard to understand, but it can also be challenging to analyze all of these numbers across multiple columns. Instead, we can first convert these numbers to categories that indicate whether the factor has a high impact on the happiness score or a low impact using the following function:
def label(element):
    if element > 1:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
Although pandas provides many built-in functions for common data cleaning tasks, in this case, the tranformation we need to perform is so specific to our data that one doesn't exist. Luckily, pandas has a couple methods that can be used to apply a custom function like the one above to our data, starting with the following two methods:
Series.map() method
Series.apply() method
Both methods above apply a function element-wise to a column. When we say element-wise, we mean that we pass the function one value in the series at a time and it performs some kind of transformation.
Map_Generic
We use the following syntax for both methods:
Map_Apply_Syntax
Note that these methods both take a function as a parameter. Because we're using the function as a parameter, we pass it into the function without the parentheses. For example, if we were working with a function called transform, we'd pass it into the apply() method as follows:
def transform(val):
    return val
Series.apply(transform)
Let's compare the two methods in the next exercise.

Instructions

Use the Series.map() method to apply the label function to the Economy column in happiness2015. Assign the result to economy_impact_map.
Use the Series.apply() method to apply the function to the Economy column. Assign the result to economy_impact_apply.
Use the following code to check if the methods produce the same result: economy_impact_map.equals(economy_impact_apply). Assign the result to a variable named equal.'''

'''Para aplicar funciones podemos usar dos metodos de pandas que
Series.map() o Series.apply(), en este ejemplo primero se define la funciÃ³n
para que vaya de label en label y asigne Alto o Bajo de acuerdo al valor'''


def label(element):
    if element > 1:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'How'

happiness_2015_map = happiness_2015['Economy'].map(label)
happiness_2015_apply = happiness_2015['Economy'].apply(label)
equal = happiness_2015_map.equals(happiness_2015_apply)

'''In the last exercise, we applied a function to the Economy column using the Series.map() and Series.apply() methods and confirmed that both methods produce the same results.

Note that these methods don't modify the original series. If we want to work with the new series in the original dataframe, we must either assign the results back to the original column or create a new column. We recommend creating a new column, in case you need to reference the original values. Let's do that next:

def label(element):
    if element > 1:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
happiness2015['Economy Impact'] = happiness2015['Economy'].map(label)
Below are the first couple rows of the Economy and Economy Impact columns.

Economy	Economy Impact
0	1.39651	High
1	1.30232	High
2	1.32548	High
3	1.45900	High
4	1.32629	High
To create the Economy Impact column, map() and apply() iterate through the Economy column and pass each value into the label function. The function evaluates which range the value belongs to and assigns the corresponding value to the element in the new column.

Map
Since both map and apply can apply functions element-wise to a series, you may be wondering about the difference between them. Let's start by looking at a function with arguments.

In the label function, we arbitrarily split the values into 'High' and 'Low'. What if instead we allowed that number to be passed into the function as an argument?

def label(element, x):
    if element > x:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
economy_map = happiness2015['Economy'].map(label, x = .8)
When we try to apply the function to the Economy column with the map method, we get an error:

TypeError: map() got an unexpected keyword argument 'x'
Let's confirm the behavior of the apply method next.

Instructions

Update label to take in another argument named x. If the element is greater than x, return 'High'. Otherwise, return 'Low'.
Then, use the apply method to apply label to the Economy column and set the x argument to 0.8. Save the result back to economy_impact_apply.'''

def label(element, x):
    if element > x:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
economy_impact_apply = happiness_2015['Economy'].apply(label,x = 0.8)

'''We learned in the last screen that we can only use the Series.apply() method to apply a function with additional arguments element-wise - the Series.map() method will return an error.

So far, we've transformed just one column at a time. If we wanted to transform more than one column, we could use the Series.map() or Series.apply() method to transform them as follows:

def label(element):
    if element > 1:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
happiness2015['Economy Impact'] = happiness2015['Economy'].apply(label)
happiness2015['Health Impact'] = happiness2015['Health'].apply(label)
happiness2015['Family Impact'] = happiness2015['Family'].apply(label)
However, it would be easier to just apply the same function to all of the factor columns (Economy, Health, Family, Freedom, Generosity, Trust) at once. Fortunately, however, pandas already has a method that can apply functions element-wise to multiple columns at once - the DataFrame.applymap() method.

We'll use the following syntax to work with the df.applymap() method:

Applymap_syntax
Just like with the Series.map() and Series.apply() methods, we need to pass the function name into the df.applymap() method without parentheses.

Let's practice using the df.applymap() method next.'''

def label(element):
    if element > 1:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Low'
economy_apply = happiness_2015['Economy'].apply(label)
factors = ['Economy', 'Family', 'Health', 'Freedom', 'Trust', 'Generosity']

'''Instructions

We've already created a list named factors containing the column names for the six factors that contribute to the happiness score.

Use the df.applymap() method to apply the label function to the columns saved in factors in happiness2015. Assign the result to factors_impact.'''
factors_impact = happiness_2015[factors].applymap(label)

'''Method
Series or Dataframe Method	Applies Functions Element-wise?
Map	Series	Yes
Apply	Series	Yes
Applymap	Dataframe	Yes'''

'''Let's use the df.apply() method to calculate the number of 'High' and 'Low' values in 
each column of the result from the last exercise, factors_impact. In order to do so, we'll
 apply the pd.value_counts function to all of the columns in the dataframe:'''

factors_impact.apply(pd.value_counts)

'''Instructions
Create a function named v_counts that accepts one parameter called col.
Use the Series.value_counts() method to calculate the value counts for col. Assign the 
result to num.
Use the Series.size attribute to calculate the number of rows in the column. Assign the 
result to den.
Divide num by den and return the result.
Use the df.apply() method to apply the v_counts function to all of the columns in factors_
impact. Assign the result to v_counts_pct.'''

def v_count(col):
    num = col.value_counts()
    den = col.size
    return (num / den)

v_counts_pct = factors_impact.apply(v_count)

'''In the last exercise, we created a function that calculates the percentage of 'High' and 
'Low' values in each column and applied it to factors_impact:

def v_counts(col):
    num = col.value_counts()
    den = col.size
    return num/den
v_counts_pct = factors_impact.apply(v_counts)
The result is a dataframe containing the percentage of 'High' and 'Low' values in each 
column:

Economy	Family	Health	Freedom	Trust	Generosity
High	0.417722	0.563291	0.012658	NaN	NaN	NaN
Low	0.582278	0.436709	0.987342	1.0	1.0	1.0
In general, we should only use the apply() method when a vectorized function does
not exist. Recall that pandas uses vectorization, the process of applying operations to 
whole series at once, to optimize performance. When we use the apply() method, we're actually
looping through rows, so a vectorized method can perform an equivalent task faster than the apply() method.

Next, we'll compare two different ways of performing an analysis task. First, we'll use the 
df.apply() method to transform the data. Then, we'll look at an alternate way to perform the
same task with vectorized methods.

One thing you probably didn't notice about the factor columns is that the sum of the six 
factors and the Dystopia Residual column equals the happiness score:

#Calculate the sum of the factor columns in each row.
happiness2015['Factors Sum'] = happiness2015[['Economy', 'Family', 'Health', 'Freedom', 
'Trust', 'Generosity', 'Dystopia Residual']].sum(axis=1)
â
#Display the first five rows of the result and the Happiness Score column.
happiness2015[['Happiness Score', 'Factors Sum']].head()
Happiness Score	Factors Sum
0	7.587	7.58696
1	7.561	7.56092
2	7.527	7.52708
3	7.522	7.52222
4	7.427	7.42694
The values we calculated in the Factors Sum column are slightly different than the values 
in the Happiness Score column, but the differences are so minor that we can attribute them 
to rounding. Because the sum of the seven columns equal the happiness score, we can convert 
them to percentages and analyze them as proportions of the happiness score instead.
Let's use the df.apply() method to convert each of the values in the six factor columns and 
the Dystopia Residual column to percentages.'''

'''Instructions

Create a function named percentages that accepts one parameter called col.
Divide col by the Happiness Score column. Assign the result to div.
Multiply div by 100 and return the result.
Use the df.apply() method to apply the percentages function to all of the columns in factors. 
Assign the result to factor_percentages.'''

def percentages(col):
    div = col/happiness_2015['Happiness Score']
    return div * 100

factors_percentages = happiness_2015[factors].apply(percentages)

'''In the last exercise, we used the df.apply() method to convert the six factor columns and the Dystopia Residual column to percentages. Below are the first five rows of the result:

Economy	Family	Health	Freedom	Trust	Generosity	Dystopia Residual
0	18.406617	17.787136	12.408462	8.772506	5.532885	3.911691	33.180177
1	17.224177	18.545563	12.535908	8.315963	1.870784	5.770401	35.736146
2	17.609672	18.075993	11.620035	8.627342	6.424472	4.535539	33.108011

However, it would be easier to convert these numbers into percentages, plot the results, and perform other data analysis tasks if we first reshaped the dataframe so that one column holds the values for all six factors and the Dystopia Residual column. We can accomplish this with the pd.melt() function.
To demonstrate this function, let's just work with a subset of happiness2015 called happy_two.

Country	Happiness Score	Economy	Family	Health
0	Switzerland	7.587	1.39651	1.34951	0.94143
1	Iceland	7.561	1.30232	1.40223	0.94784

Below, we use the melt function to reshape happy_two so that the values for Economy, Family, and Health reside in the same column:

pd.melt(happy_two, id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['Economy', 'Family', 'Health'])

Below are the results:

Country	variable	value
0	Switzerland	Economy	1.39651
1	Iceland	Economy	1.30232
2	Switzerland	Family	1.34951
3	Iceland	Family	1.40223
4	Switzerland	Health	0.94143
5	Iceland	Health	0.94784
Now, we can use vectorized operations to transform the value column at once!
Here's a summary of the syntax we used to work with the melt function:
Melt_syntax
Let's reshape all of happiness2015 with the melt function next.

Instructions

Use the melt function to reshape happiness2015. The columns listed in main_cols should
stay the same. The columns listed in factors should be transformed into rows. 
Assign the result to a variable called melt.
Convert the value column to a percentage.
Divide the value column by the Happiness Score column and multiply the result by 100.
Use the round() function to round the result to 2 decimal places.
Assign the result to a new column called Percentage.'''
main_cols = ['Country', 'Region', 'Happiness Rank', 'Happiness Score']
melt = pd.melt(happiness_2015, id_vars = main_cols, value_vars = factors)
melt['Percentage'] = round((melt['value']/melt['Happiness Score'])*100, 2)

'''Instructions

Use the df.pivot_table() method to create a pivot table from the melt dataframe.
Set the variable column as the index and the value column as the values. Assign the result 
to pv_melt.
Use the df.plot() method to create a pie chart of the results. Set the kind parameter to 
'pie', the y parameter to 'value', and the legend parameter to False, so we can better see
the results.
If we disregard Dystopia Residual, which two factors, on average, contribute the most to the
happiness score?'''

melt = pd.melt(happiness_2015, id_vars = ['Country', 'Region', 'Happiness Rank', 'Happiness Score'], value_vars= ['Economy', 'Family', 'Health', 'Freedom', 'Trust', 'Generosity', 'Dystopia Residual'])
