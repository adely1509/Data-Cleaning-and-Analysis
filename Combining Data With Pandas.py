'''In the last mission, we worked with just one data set, the 2015 World Happiness Report, to explore data aggregation. However, it's very common in practice to work with more than one data set at a time.
Often, you'll find that you need additional data to perform analysis or you'll find that you have the data, but need to pull it from mulitiple sources. In this mission, we'll learn a couple of different techniques for combining data using pandas to easily handle situations like these.
We'll use what we learned in the last mission to analyze the 2015, 2016, and 2017 World Happiness Reports. Specifically, we'll look to answer the following question:
Did world happiness increase, decrease, or stay about the same from 2015 to 2017?
As a reminder, these reports assign each country a happiness score based on a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10, so "world happiness" refers to this definition specifically.
Below is a preview of the 2015 report:
Country	Region	Happiness Rank	Happiness Score	Standard Error	Economy (GDP per Capita)	Family	Health (Life Expectancy)	Freedom	Trust (Government Corruption)	Generosity	Dystopia Residual
0	Switzerland	Western Europe	1	7.587	0.03411	1.39651	1.34951	0.94143	0.66557	0.41978	0.29678	2.51738
1	Iceland	Western Europe	2	7.561	0.04884	1.30232	1.40223	0.94784	0.62877	0.14145	0.43630	2.70201
2	Denmark	Western Europe	3	7.527	0.03328	1.32548	1.36058	0.87464	0.64938	0.48357	0.34139	2.49204
3	Norway	Western Europe	4	7.522	0.03880	1.45900	1.33095	0.88521	0.66973	0.36503	0.34699	2.46531
4	Canada	North America	5	7.427	0.03553	1.32629	1.32261	0.90563	0.63297	0.32957	0.45811	2.45176
Below are descriptions for some of the columns:
Country - Name of the country
Region - Name of the region the country belongs to
Happiness Rank - The rank of the country, as determined by its happiness score
Happiness Score - A score assigned to each country based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10
Let's start by reading the 2015, 2016, and 2017 reports into a pandas dataframe and adding a Year column to each to make it easier to distinguish between them.

Instructions

We've already read the World_Happiness_2015.csv file into a dataframe called happiness2015.
Use the pandas.read_csv() function to read the World_Happiness_2016.csv file into a dataframe called happiness2016 and the World_Happiness_2017.csv file into a dataframe called happiness2017.
Add a column called Year to each dataframe with the corresponding year. For example, the Year column in happiness2015 should contain the value 2015 for each row.'''
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

happiness_2015 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2015.csv")
happiness_2016 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2016.csv")
happiness_2017 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2017.csv")

'''AÃ±adimos columnas a los df'''

happiness_2015['Year'] = 2015
happiness_2016['Year'] = 2016
happiness_2017['Year'] = 2017

'''Let's start by exploring the pd.concat() function. The concat() function combines dataframes one of two ways:
Stacked: Axis = 0 (This is the default option.)
Concat_Updated
Side by Side: Axis = 1
Concat_Axis1
Since concat is a function, not a method, we use the syntax below:
Concat_syntax
In the next exercise, we'll use the concat() function to combine subsets of happiness2015 and happiness2016 and then debrief the results on the following screen.
Below are the subsets we'll be working with:
head_2015 = happiness2015[['Country','Happiness Score', 'Year']].head(3)
Country	Happiness Score	Year
0	Switzerland	7.587	2015
1	Iceland	7.561	2015
2	Denmark	7.527	2015
head_2016 = happiness2016[['Country','Happiness Score', 'Year']].head(3)
Country	Happiness Score	Year
0	Denmark	7.526	2016
1	Switzerland	7.509	2016
2	Iceland	7.501	2016
Let's use the concat() function to combine head_2015 and head_2016 next.

Instructions

We've already saved the subsets from happiness2015 and happiness2016 to the variables head_2015 and head_2016.
Use the pd.concat() function to combine head_2015 and head_2016 along axis = 0. Remember to pass the head_2015 and head_2016 into the function as a list. Assign the result to concat_axis0.
Use the pd.concat() function to combine head_2015 and head_2016 along axis = 1. Remember to pass head_2015 and head_2016 into the function as a list and set the axis parameter equal to 1. Assign the result to concat_axis1.
Use the variable inspector to view concat_axis0 and concat_axis1.
Assign the number of rows in concat_axis0 to a variable called question1.
Assign the number of rows in concat_axis1 to a variable called question2.'''

head_2015 = happiness_2015[['Country','Happiness Score', 'Year']].head(3)
head_2016 = happiness_2016[['Country','Happiness Score', 'Year']].head(3)

concat_axis0 = pd.concat([head_2015, head_2016], axis = 0)
concat_axis1 = pd.concat([head_2015, head_2016], axis = 1)
question1 = 6
question2 = 3

head_2015 = happiness_2015[['Year','Country','Happiness Score', 'Standard Error']].head(4)
head_2016 = happiness_2016[['Country','Happiness Score', 'Year']].head(3)
concat_axis0 = pd.concat([head_2015, head_2016])
'''Note that because the Standard Error column didn't exist in head_2016, NaN values were created to signify those values are missing. By default, the concat function will keep ALL of the data, no matter if missing values are created.
Also, notice again the indexes of the original dataframes didn't change. If the indexes aren't meaningful, it can be better to reset them. This is especially true when we create duplicate indexes, because they could cause errors as we perform other data cleaning tasks.
Luckily, the concat function has a parameter, ignore_index, that can be used to clear the existing index and reset it in the result. Let's practice using it next.'''

concat_update_index = pd.concat([head_2015, head_2016], ignore_index = True)

'''Next, we'll explore the pd.merge() function - a function that can execute high performance database-style joins. Note that unlike the concat function, the merge function only combines dataframes horizontally (axis=1) and can only combine two dataframes at a time. However, it can be valuable when we need to combine very large dataframes quickly and provides more flexibility in terms of how data can be combined, as we'll see in the next couple screens.
With the merge() function, we'll combine dataframes on a key, a shared index or column. When choosing a key, it's good practice to use keys with unique values to avoid duplicating data.
You can think of keys as creating a link from one dataframe to another using the common values or indexes. For example, in the diagram below, we linked the dataframes using common values in the Country columns.
Merge_link
In the diagram below, we use those common country values to join or merge the dataframes.
Merge
We'll explore the merge function in the next exercise using just three rows from happiness2015 and happiness2016:
happiness2015[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:5]
Country	Happiness Rank	Year
2	Denmark	3	2015
3	Norway	4	2015
4	Canada	5	2015
happiness2016[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:5]
Country	Happiness Rank	Year
2	Iceland	3	2016
3	Norway	4	2016
4	Finland	5	2016
We'll use the following syntax:
Merge_syntax
Let's practice using the merge() function next.

Instructions
We've already saved three rows from happiness2015 and happiness2016 to variables named three_2015 and three_2016.
Use the pd.merge() function to join three_2015 and three_2016 on the Country column. Assign the result to merged.'''

three_2015 = happiness_2015[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:5]
three_2016 = happiness_2016[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:5]

merged = pd.merge(three_2015, three_2016, on = 'Country')

'''Joining three_2015 and three_2016 in the last exercise resulted in a dataframe with just one row:
pd.merge(left=three_2015, right=three_2016, on='Country')
Country	Happiness Rank_x	Year_x	Happiness Rank_y	Year_y
0	Norway	4	2015	4	2016
Let's look back to three_2015 and three_2016 to understand why. Since we joined the dataframes on the Country column, or used it as the key, the merge() function looked to match elements in the Country column in BOTH dataframes.
Join_columns
The one country returned in merged was "Norway", the only element that appeared in the Country column in BOTH three_2015 and three_2016.
This way of combining, or joining, data is called an inner join. An inner join returns only the intersection of the keys, or the elements that appear in both dataframes with a common key.
The term "join" originates from SQL (or structured query language), a language used to work with databases. If you're a SQL user, you'll recognize the following concepts. If you've never used SQL, don't worry! No prior knowledge is neccessary for this mission, but we will learn SQL later in this path.
There are actually four different types of joins:
Inner: only includes elements that appear in both dataframes with a common key
Outer: includes all data from both dataframes
Left: includes all of the rows from the "left" dataframe along with any rows from the "right" dataframe with a common key; the result retains all columns from both of the original dataframes
Right: includes all of the rows from the "right" dataframe along with any rows from the "left" dataframe with a common key; the result retains all columns from both of the original dataframes
If the definition for outer joins sounds familiar, it's because we've already seen examples of outer joins! Recall that when we combined data using the concat function, it kept all of the data from all dataframes, no matter if missing values were created.

Since it's much more common to use inner and left joins for database-style joins, we'll focus on these join types for the remainder of the mission, but encourage you to explore the other options on your own.
Let's experiment with changing the join type next.

Instructions

Update merged to use a left join instead of an inner join. Set the how parameter to 'left' in merge(). Assign the result to merged_left.
Update merged_left so that the left parameter equals three_2016 and the right parameter equals three_2015. Assign the result to merged_left_updated.
Based on the results of this exercise, when using a left join, does changing the dataframe assigned to the left and right parameters change the result? Try to answer this question before moving onto the next screen.'''

merged = pd.merge(left=three_2015, right=three_2016, on='Country')
merged_left = pd.merge(three_2015, three_2016, how = 'left', on = 'Country')
merged_left_updated = pd.merge(three_2016, three_2015, how = 'left', on = 'Country')

'''Instructions

Update merged to use the suffixes _2015 and _2016. Set the suffixes parameter to ('_2015', '_2016') in merge(). Assign the result to merged_suffixes.
Update merged_updated to use the suffixes _2015 and _2016. Notice that the "left" dataframe is three_2016 and the "right" dataframe is three_2015. Assign the result to merged_updated_suffixes.'''

merged_updated = pd.merge(left=three_2016, right=three_2015, how = 'left', on='Country')
merged_suffixes = pd.merge(left=three_2015, right=three_2016, how = 'left', on='Country', suffixes = ('_2015', '_2016'))
merged_updated_suffixes = pd.merge(left=three_2016, right=three_2015, how = 'left', on='Country',suffixes = ('_2016', '_2015'))

'''Instructions

We've already saved four_2015 and three_2016. In this exercise, we'll use a left join to combine four_2015 and three_2016.
Predict the number of rows and columns the resulting dataframe will have. Assign the number of rows to a variable called rows and the number of columns to a variable called columns.
To change the join type used in merge_index to a left join, set the how parameter equal to 'left'. Save the result to merge_index_left.
Update rows and columns so that each contains the correct number of rows and columns in merge_index_left.'''

four_2015 = happiness2015[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:6]
three_2016 = happiness2016[['Country','Happiness Rank','Year']].iloc[2:5]
merge_index = pd.merge(left = four_2015,right = three_2016, left_index = True, right_index = True, suffixes = ('_2015','_2016'))
rows = 4
columns = 6
merge_index_left = pd.merge(left = four_2015, right = three_2016, how = 'left', left_index = True, right_index = True, suffixes = ('_2015', '_2016'))

'''Learn
Let's summarize what we learned in this mission:
pd.concat()	pd.merge()
Default Join Type	Outer	Inner
Can Combine More Than Two Dataframes at a Time?	Yes	No
Can Combine Dataframes Vertically
(axis=0) or Horizontally (axis=1)?
Both	Horizontally
Syntax	Concat (Vertically)
concat([df1,df2,df3])
Concat (Horizontally)
concat([df1,df2,df3], axis = 1)
Merge (Join on Columns)
merge(left = df1, right = df2, how = 'join_type', on = 'Col')
Merge (Join on Index)
merge(left = df1, right = df2, how = 'join_type', left_index = True, right_index = True)
You may still be wondering about when to use each of the functions and methods we've learned. This table can help you understand the limitations of each, but that decision will mostly depend on the problem you're trying to solve.
Let's review our original question next:
Did world happiness increase, decrease, or stay about the same from 2015 to 2017?
To answer this question, we'll create a bar plot in which each bar represented the mean happiness score for one of the years. We completed a similar task in the last mission when we calculated the mean happiness score for each region using the df.pivot_table() method:
#Use a pivot table to aggregate the data according to Region.
means = happiness2015.pivot_table('Happiness Score', 'Region', aggfunc=np.mean)
Happiness Score
Region	
Australia and New Zealand	7.285000
Central and Eastern Europe	5.332931
Eastern Asia	5.626167
Latin America and Caribbean	6.144682
Middle East and Northern Africa	5.406900
North America	7.273000
Southeastern Asia	5.317444
Southern Asia	4.580857
Sub-Saharan Africa	4.202800
Western Europe	6.689619
Then, we plotted the results with the df.plot() method.

#Use the `df.plot()` method to plot the results.
means.plot(kind='barh', title='Mean Happiness Scores by Region', xlim=(0,10))
Mean_Happiness
Let's repeat the same steps, but this time, we'll group the data by the Year column. First, let's rename the Happiness.Score column so it matches the column name in happiness2015 and happiness2016:
happiness2017.rename(columns={'Happiness.Score': 'Happiness Score'}, inplace=True)
Next, we need to combine happiness2015, happiness2016, and happiness2017, so that we can group the result by the Year column.
Let's use what we learned in this mission to combine the dataframes.

Instructions

We've already created a Year column in happiness2017 and renamed the Happiness.Score column to Happiness Score.
Use either the pd.concat() function or the pd.merge() function to combine happiness2015, happiness2016, and happiness2017. Assign the result to combined.
Think about whether you need to combine the data horizontally or vertically in order to create a dataframe that can be grouped by year, and decide which function (pd.concat() or pd.merge()) you can use to combine the data.
Use the df.pivot_table() method to create a pivot table from the combined dataframe. Set Year as the index and Happiness Score as the values. Assign the result to pivot_table_combined.
Use the df.plot() method to create a bar chart of the results. Set the kind parameter to barh, the title to 'Mean Happiness Scores by Year', and the xlim parameter to (0,10).
Try to answer the following question based on the results of this exercise: Did world happiness increase, decrease, or stay about the same from 2015 to 2017?'''

combined = pd.concat([happiness_2015, happiness_2016, happiness_2017])
pivot_table_combined = combined.pivot_table('Happiness Score', 'Year', aggfunc = np.mean)
pivot_table_combined.plot(kind = 'barh', title = 'Mean Happiness Scores by Year', xlim = (0, 10))
